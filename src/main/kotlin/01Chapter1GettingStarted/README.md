# Getting Started

* Use **fun** to define a function.<br><br>
* Every application needs a function named **main**.<br><br>
* Use **//** to denote a single-lined comment.<br><br>
* A String is a string of characters. You denote a String value by enclosing its
  characters in double quotes.<br><br>
* Code blocks are defined by a pair of curly braces **{ }**.<br><br>
* The assignment operator is *one* equals sign **=**.<br><br>
* The equals operator uses *two* equals signs **==**.<br><br>
* Use **var** to define a variable whose value may change.<br><br>
* Use **val** to define a value whose value will stay the same.<br><br>
* A **while loop** runs everything within its block so long as the conditional
  test is true.<br><br>
* If the conditional test is false, the **while loop** code block won't run, and
  execution will move down to the code immediately after the loop block.<br><br>
* Put a conditional test inside parentheses **( )**.<br><br>
* Add conditional branches to your code using **if** and **else**. The **else
  clause** is optional.<br><br>
* You can use if as an expression so that it returns a value. In this case,
  the **else clause** is mandatory.<br><br>
