# Classes and objects
* Classes let you define yur own types.<br><br>
* A class is a template for an object. One class can create many objects.<br><br>
* The things an object knows about itself are its properties. The things an object can do are its functions.<br><br>
* A property is a variable that's local to the class.<br><br>
* The **class** keyword defines a class.<br><br>
* Use the dot operator to access an object's properties and functions.<br><br>
* A constructor runs when you initialize an object.<br><br>
* You can define a property in the primary constructor by prefixing a parameter with a **val** or **var** You can define a property outside the constructor by adding it to the class body.<br><br>
* Initializer blocks run when an object is initialized.<br><br>
* You must initialize each property before you use its value.<br><br>
* Getters and setters let you get and set property values.<br><br>
* Behind the scenes, the compiler adds a default getter and setter to every property.<br><br>
