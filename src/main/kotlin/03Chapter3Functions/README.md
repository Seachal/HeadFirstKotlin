# Functions

* Use functions to organize your code and make it more reusable.<br><br>
* A function can have parameters, so you can pass mor than one value to
  it.<br><br>
* The number and type of values you pass to the function must match the order
  and type of the parameters declared by the function.<br><br>
* A function can return a value. You must define the type of value (if any) it
  returns.<br><br>
* A **Unit** return type means that the function doesn't return
  anything.<br><br>
* Choose **for loops** over **while loops** when you know how many times you
  want to repeat the loop code.<br><br>
* The **readLine( )** function reads a line of input from the standard input
  stream. It returns a String value, the text entered by the user.<br><br>
* If the input stream has been redirected to a file and the end of the file has
  been reached, the **readLine( )** function returns **null**. **null** means it
  has no value, or it's missing.<br><br>
* **&&** means "and". **||** means "or". **!** means "not".
